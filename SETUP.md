# SETUP

Make sure to have a server running with the software requirements as outlined in the [README](README.md#requirements). The following parts outline how to configure 1100CC:

 - [1100CC](SETUP.md#1100cc): install and configure 1100CC.
 - [Server](SETUP.md#server): configure the LAMP software packages for the server.
 - [Programs](SETUP.md#programs): create and compile 1100CC programs, optional.

## 1100CC

Create a directory on your server where you put all files from the 1100CC folder, we will use `/var/1100CC`.

Next, configure the LAMP software packages for the [server](SETUP.md#server).

To create a new site/application in the 1100CC installation, do the following:
 1. The directory `./APP/SITE` contains the default files and directories for a new site/application, copy and rename this folder to the name of your site/application.
 1. Copy and rename the directory `./APP/SETTINGS/SITE` to your new site/application name.
 1. Copy and rename the directory `./APP/STORAGE/SITE` to your new site/application name.
 1. From now on \*SITE\* refers to your site/application's name.
 1. Add an alias (or multiple aliases) to `./APP/alias` that links a domain to your site/application: e.g. `yourdomain.com \*SITE\*` and/or `sub.domain.yourdomain.com \*SITE\*`
 1. Add the appropriate databases for both the HOME and CMS of your new \*SITE\*, see [database SITE](SETUP.md#database-site).
 1. Edit the `./APP/SETTINGS/*SITE*/settings.php` to configure the database passwords, and to override any default settings if required.
 1. Go to the CMS by adding cms. to your SITE's domain e.g. `cms.yourdomain.com`, and start building! See the [1100CC Guides](https://lab1100.com/1100cc/guides) on how to get started.
 
## Server

### Apache webserver

Include and adjust the following VirtualHost configuration to your Apache config to direct all relevant traffic (domain and HTTP/80 and or HTTPS/443) to the 1100CC `./APP` root directory:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerAlias *
	ServerName 1100cc.youserver.com:80

	# Get the server name from the Host: header
	UseCanonicalName Off

	# Remove line breaks
	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteRule ^(.*)(?:\r?\n|\r)(.*)? $1$2 [N]

	# Set document root
	DocumentRoot /var/1100CC/APP

	# 1100CC mapping
	RewriteMap alias txt:/var/1100CC/APP/alias

	<Directory /var/1100CC/APP>
		#SSLRequireSSL
		Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks
		AllowOverride All
		Require all granted
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>
``` 

When your Linux distrubiton applies SELinux:
 - Apache needs write access (i.e. httpd_sys_rw_content_t) to the `./APP/CACHE` and `./APP/STORAGE` directories.
 - Make sure to allow Apache to use the mailserver (i.e. httpd_can_network_connect, httpd_can_sendmail).

### PHP

1100CC uses the following modules, check your distribution (e.g. Debian- or Red Hat-based distributions) to see which ones are installed by default or your need to add them:
 - xml
 - gd
 - mbstring
 - mysql
 - pgsql
 - curl
 - zip
 - libapache2-mod

### Database

Indicate which database to use by creating a file `./APP/SETTINGS/*SITE*/database` with either 'mysql' / 'mariadb' / 'postgresql' as its contents. 

#### MySQL

##### Database CORE

Create 2 MySQL users with a password of your choice:

```sql
CREATE USER 1100CC_cms@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '*PASSWORD*';
CREATE USER 1100CC_home@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '*PASSWORD*';
```

Create the 1100CC CORE database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE 1100CC CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```
Grant the MySQL users their 1100CC CORE privileges:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON 1100CC.* TO 1100CC_cms@localhost;
GRANT SELECT ON 1100CC.* TO 1100CC_home@localhost;
```

##### Database SITE

Create a HOME and a CMS database for each SITE (replace \*SITE\* with your site/application's name) you want hosted by 1100CC:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE *SITE*_cms CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE DATABASE *SITE*_home CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

Grant the MySQL users their HOME and a CMS privileges:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES ON *SITE*_home.* TO 1100CC_cms@localhost;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON *SITE*_home.* TO 1100CC_home@localhost;

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES ON *SITE*_cms.* TO 1100CC_cms@localhost;
GRANT SELECT ON *SITE*_cms.* TO 1100CC_home@localhost;
```

Import the SQL from [1100CC.sql](setup/1100CC.sql) to the 1100CC CORE database.
Import the SQL from [1100CC.core_language.sql](setup/1100CC.core_language.sql) to the 1100CC CORE database.
Import the SQL from [1100CC.core_labels.en.sql](setup/1100CC.core_labels.en.sql) to the 1100CC CORE database, and also other languages by their code ('nl'/'de') if needed.
Import the SQL from [SITE_cms.sql](setup/SITE_cms.sql) to the SITE CMS database.
Import the SQL from [SITE_home.sql](setup/SITE_home.sql) to the SITE HOME database.

#### PostgreSQL

Currently MySQL works as a master for development, you can use [PGLoader](https://pgloader.io/) to transfer the MySQL structure to PostgreSQL and work from there, e.g. use a PGLoader script with:

```sql
LOAD DATABASE
	FROM mysql://root:*PASSWORD*@127.0.0.1/1100CC
	INTO postgresql://postgres:*PASSWORD*@127.0.0.1/CC1100
;
```

```sql
LOAD DATABASE
	FROM mysql://root:*PASSWORD*@127.0.0.1/*SITE*_home
	INTO postgresql://postgres:*PASSWORD*@127.0.0.1/CC1100
;

LOAD DATABASE
	FROM mysql://root:*PASSWORD*@127.0.0.1/*SITE*_cms
	INTO postgresql://postgres:*PASSWORD*@127.0.0.1/CC1100

	AFTER LOAD DO

		$$ CREATE VIEW *SITE*_cms.view_user_parent AS SELECT u.id AS id, u.name AS parent_name, u.group_id AS parent_group_id FROM *SITE*_cms.users AS u; $$
;
```

Add a file called 'database' with the contents 'postgresql' in the SITE's `./APP/SETTINGS/*SITE*` directory.

## Programs

The `./PROGRAMS` directory provides an environment to create and build services using C++. The `creation_station.sh` script found in `./PROGRAMS/LIBRARIES` helps you to build and link programs to `./PROGRAMS/RUN`.

### Libraries

Libraries needed for inclusion:
 - RapidJSON ([download](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson))

Libraries that need to be compiled:
 - CMake 3.12+ ([download](https://cmake.org/download/))
 - Boost 1.67+ ([download](https://www.boost.org/users/download/))
 
Libraries that first need to be complied can be stored in the `./PROGRAMS/LIBRARIES/BUILD` directory (e.g. `./PROGRAMS/LIBRARIES/BUILD/boost`). Libraries that only need inclusion can directly be stored in the `./PROGRAMS/LIBRARIES` directory (e.g. `./PROGRAMS/LIBRARIES/rapidjson`).
 
Make sure you have the necessary build tools available, e.g. on a Debian-based distribution:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

#### CMake

CMake can probably be installed from your distribution's repository, however often the version available is dated. To install CMake manually and system-wide:

```bash
cd /var/1100CC/PROGRAMS/LIBRARIES/BUILD/cmake

./bootstrap
make -j4
sudo make install

make clean
rm ./CMakeCache.txt
```

#### Boost

The main 1100CC libraries make use of Boost functions, and is very handy to have anyway.

```bash
cd /var/1100CC/PROGRAMS/LIBRARIES/BUILD/boost

./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/var/1100CC/PROGRAMS/LIBRARIES/boost/
./b2 install --build-dir=/tmp/build-boost

make clean
```

### Creation Station

Use to `creation_station.sh` script to build and link any program needed.

```bash
cd /var/1100CC/PROGRAMS
./creation_station.sh
```

When a program is compiled successfully, the path to the program in `/var/1100CC/PROGRAMS/RUN` is returned and is ready to be used by 1100CC.
